# JEDI-Flipfit
# Flipfit: A Gym Booking Platform

Welcome to Flipfit! This project is a comprehensive gym and slot booking application that has evolved from a command-line interface to a modern, RESTful web service.

This guide provides all the necessary steps to set up, run, and thoroughly test both the legacy console application and the new Dropwizard REST API.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed and configured on your system:

*   **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 11 or higher (the project is compiled with Java 14).
*   **Apache Maven:** The standard Java build and dependency management tool.
*   **MySQL Server & MySQL Workbench:** To host and manage the application's database.
*   **IntelliJ IDEA:** The recommended Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for this project.
*   **Postman:** An API platform for building and using APIs. We will use this to test our REST endpoints.

## 2. Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### Step 2.1: Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the repository to a location of your choice:

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
```

### Step 2.2: Set Up the Database

The application requires a MySQL database named `Flipfit`.

1.  **Create the Database:** Open MySQL Workbench and run the following command to create the database schema:
    ```sql
    CREATE SCHEMA Flipfit;
    ```

2.  **Run the Setup Script:** This repository includes a master SQL script that will create all the necessary tables and populate them with a rich set of dummy data for testing.
    *   Locate the file named `schema.sql` in the root of the repository.
    *   Open `schema.sql` in MySQL Workbench.
    *   Execute the entire script. This will drop any old tables, create new ones, and insert all the test data.

### Step 2.3: Configure the Database Connection

The application's database password needs to be configured to match your local MySQL setup.

1.  Navigate to the following file in the project:
    `JEDI-Flipkart-Development-Group-B/src/main/java/com/flipfit/dao/DBConnection.java`

2.  In this file, find the following line:
    ```java
    return DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/Flipfit","root","aXath2oo!@#%");
    ```

3.  Change the password (`"aXath2oo!@#%"`) to your own local MySQL root password.

### Step 2.4: Build the Project with Maven

1.  Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
2.  Allow IntelliJ to import the project as a Maven project. It will read the `pom.xml` file and automatically download all the required libraries (like Dropwizard). This may take a few minutes.
3.  If you encounter any dependency errors, open the Maven tool window (`View -> Tool Windows -> Maven`) and click the "Reload All Maven Projects" button.

## 3. Running the Application

This project has two different entry points: the original console application and the new Dropwizard web service.

### Part A: Running the Console Application (Legacy)

1.  In the IntelliJ Project Explorer, navigate to:
    `src/main/java/com/flipfit/client/GymFlipfitApplicationClient.java`
2.  Right-click on the `GymFlipfitApplicationClient.java` file.
3.  Select "Run 'GymFlipfitApplicationClient.main()'".
4.  The console application will start in the "Run" window at the bottom of IntelliJ.

### Part B: Running the Dropwizard REST API

1.  In the top-right corner of IntelliJ, click on "**Add Configuration...**".
2.  In the window that opens, click the **+** button and select **Application**.
3.  Configure the runner as follows:
    *   **Name:** `Run Flipfit Server`
    *   **Main class:** Click the `...` button and select `FlipfitApplication`.
    *   **Program arguments:** Type `server`.
4.  Click **Apply** and then **OK**.
5.  Click the green "Run" (**â–¶**) button to start the server. The console will show a success message when the API is live at `http://localhost:8080`.

## 4. Comprehensive Testing Guide

This guide covers all functionalities of the application. For API testing, use Postman.

### Part B: Console Application Smoke Test

This is to verify that the legacy application still functions as expected.

1.  Run the Console App as described in section 3A.
2.  **Test Admin Flow:**
    *   Log in as `admin` / `pass` (role 2).
    *   Choose option `2` to view pending gyms. Verify 'Iron Paradise' is listed.
    *   Approve 'Iron Paradise' (ID 2).
3.  **Test Customer Flow:**
    *   Log in as `customer1` / `pass` (role 0).
    *   Choose option `1` to view gyms. Verify that the newly approved 'Iron Paradise' is now visible.
    *   Proceed to book an available slot.
4.  **Test Owner Flow:**
    *   Log in as `owner1` / `pass` (role 1).
    *   Choose option `2` to view your gyms. Verify the status of 'Iron Paradise' is now "Approved".
    *   Choose option `4` to add a new slot to one of your approved gyms.
